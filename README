quickstatd gathers OS-level performance statistics and sends
them to a running instance of Graphite.

quickstatd is not the most efficient way to get monitoring done.
It is a collection of bash shell scripts that gather the output
from existing system monitoring tools like vmstat, sar, and iostat,
and forwards the data on to Graphite where it can be
visualized.

I wrote for the following reasons:

  * I wanted something simple I could get up and running fast, with
    minimal fuss and configuration.

  * I wanted something I could easily push into an environment that
    has no internet access.  Installing .deb or .rpm packages was
    problematic due to long dependancy chains of existing tools.

For a more robust, production-ready monitoring solution, look at
alternatives like collectd (with graphite plugin).

Quickstatd is tested and works on CentOS (Fedora) and Ubuntu
(Debian).  With small modifications it could be made to work
on OS X, Solaris, etc.  It is most suited to small environments or
test installations.


Prerequisites:
    * the systat package must be installed if you wish to use the 
      various 'sar' and 'iostat' monitoring tools.  (The vmstat
      tools should work out of the box.)


To install quickstatd, run installer.sh.  Usage:

    install.sh <install dir> <graphite host> <monitor interval> [ graphite port (default is 2003) ]


Quickstatd is controlled by a standard tool in /etc/init.d.  Usage:

    /etc/init.d/quickstatd  start | stop | restart


To modify quickstatd settings (such as which metrics you wish to
monitor), edit /etc/quickstatd.conf.
