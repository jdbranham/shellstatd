quickstatd gathers OS-level performance statistics and sends
them to a running instance of Graphite.

It is a collection of bash shell scripts that gather the output
from existing system monitoring tools like vmstat, sar, and iostat,
and forwards the data on to Graphite where it can be
visualized.

There are other, more "production-ready" tools (like collectd, with
the graphite plugin) that do this.  I wrote quickstatd for the
following reasons:

  * I didn't need a ton of options, but I did want something simple I
    could get up and running fast, with minimal fuss and configuration.

  * I wanted something I could easily push into an environment that
    has no internet access.  Installing the .deb or .rpm packages for 
    collectd was problematic due to long unmet dependancy chains.


Quickstatd is tested and works on CentOS (Fedora) and Ubuntu
(Debian).  With small modifications it could be made to work
on OS X, Solaris, etc.  


Prerequisites:
    * The systat package must be installed if you wish to use the 
      'sar' and 'iostat' monitoring tools.  (The vmstat
      tools should work out of the box for all distros)  CentOS seems
      to have systat installed by default, but Debian/Ubuntu users
      need to install it via apt-get.


To install quickstatd, run installer.sh.  Usage:

    sudo install.sh <install dir> <graphite host> <monitor interval> [ graphite port (default is 2003) ]


Quickstatd is controlled by a startup script in /etc/init.d.  Usage:

    /etc/init.d/quickstatd  start | stop | restart


To modify quickstatd settings (such as which metrics you wish to
monitor), edit /etc/quickstatd.conf.
